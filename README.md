# Quantum Information & Computing: lab reports

## About this project
Quantum Information and Computing (QI&C) lab reports at the University of Padova.

* **CHSH Inequality Violation**: this research delves into the realm of quantum entanglement and its potential for violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. The CHSH inequality is a fundamental test used to explore the boundaries of classical and quantum correlations. Our lab focuses on designing and implementing experimental setups to generate entangled quantum states and perform measurements to test their correlations against the CHSH inequality. By observing violations of this inequality, we seek to demonstrate the presence of non-classical correlations, thus confirming the entangled nature of the quantum states under study;

* **Quantum Tomography** (**QT**): QT is a vital technique used to characterize and reconstruct the density matrices of quantum systems. As quantum devices are inherently noisy due to various imperfections, it becomes crucial to employ sophisticated reconstruction methods to infer accurate information about the underlying quantum state. In this context, our lab focuses on implementing Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithms to reconstruct the density matrices of quantum systems from the noisy measurement data. MLE offers a powerful and robust approach, allowing us to extract valuable insights about the quantum system's properties despite the presence of noise. Our research in this area aims to enhance the reliability and accuracy of quantum information processing protocols, where an accurate knowledge of the quantum state is of utmost importance.
